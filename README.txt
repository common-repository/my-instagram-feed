<h3>How to use the plugin</h3>

You can use My Instagram Feed plugin to display Instagram photos in a page, post or any custom post type, in the sidebar/footer, and even call it directly in a PHP file. 

After installing and activation, click on the 'My Instagram Feed' settings page to connect your Instagram account with your site by using the workflow.

<h5>My Instagram Feed Shortcode:</h5> 

Copy `[my-instagram-feed]` shortcode (or Generate it from My Instagram Feed page according to your requirements) and add into any page, post or any other shortcode aware area and let it handle the rest.

<h5>My Instagram Widget:</h5> 

Yes, you can display your stunning Instagram photos in the sidebar/footer by adding the shortcode in a text widget. Copy the shortcode and go to Appearance -> Customize -> Widgets -> Sidebar (or any other location) -> Add a widget -> search for text -> Paste the shortcode in text area, save the changes and voila! (Yes, you can add directly in any widget from Appearance -> Widgets too ;) )

<h5>Template tag:</h5> 

Last but not least, you can call in the shortcode directly in a PHP template by using this piece of code `<?php echo do_shortcode(“[my-instagram-feed]”); ?>` and let it be in the place you want.

<h3>WANT TO CUSTOMIZE?</h3>
Sure you can. Go to WP Admin -> MIF -> Skin -> Edit and make the changes in real time. 

<h3>NEED HELP?</h3>

<h3>NOTE</h3>

My Instagram feed is absolutely the simplest, most beginner friendly yet powerful and the only plugin with one-minute setup (or even less).
